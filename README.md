# heuristics

This is the gitHub repository of heuristics of Jose M Sallan. Here you will find quite simple heuristics to attack combinatorial problems, as the code here is set for teaching purposes.

At this moment this repository contains the following material

## Quadratic assignment problem (QAP)

* **QAPfunctions.R** contains several functions and algorithms to tackle the QAP using R, based on the ones defined for the TSP
* **QAP_1516.R** displays how to solve a set of 10 QAP instances. The results are displayed in the **QAPresults.html** file, generated with the **QAPresults.Rmd* R markdown file

##Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

There are two files to use for the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP):

* **tsp.R** contains several functions and algorithms to tackle the TSP using R
* **demoTSP.R** contains some examples of use of the functions of the previous file
