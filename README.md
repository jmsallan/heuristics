# heuristics

This is the gitHub repository of heuristics of Jose M Sallan. Here you will find quite simple heuristics to attack combinatorial problems, as the code here is set for teaching purposes.

At this moment this repository contains the following material

## Quadratic assignment problem (QAP)

**QAPstart.R** This is a .R file containing code to download an isntance of QAP from the QAPLIB files, and a function to assess the objective function of a QAP instance.

##Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

There are two files to use for the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP):

* **tsp.R** contains several functions and algorithms to tackle the TSP using R
* **demoTSP.R** contains some examples of use of the functions of the previous file
